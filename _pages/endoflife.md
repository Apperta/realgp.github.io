<p>As a community, we are aiming to improve the ways in which people can manage and influence their own care, treatment and support towards the end of their life. We believe that, by developing better tools to share information between health and care professionals, carers and patients,we can help to ensure that the patient feels informed and in control of the care that is given to them. We want to improve the way systems and data are used in hospitals, care homes, hospices and in patientsâ€™ own homes, so that they better recognise patients as individuals who have their own preferences, and whose wishes are listened to, understood and respected by all those involved in their care. We aim to do this by working together as a community, sharing knowledge and expertise, and working with those who have the skills to develop the necessary tools in a way that has the greatest impact for patients in cost-effective ways.</p>
