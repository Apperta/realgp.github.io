        <p align="left">Real general practice is designed to help you to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary for you to pass the clinical skills assessment exam. It will demonstrate to you: how busy GPs incorporate up-to-date knowledge and evidence based, patient-centred practice into their consultations. CSA candidates and medical students will often prefer to use our material in study groups, with or without the support of a trainer. Busy GPs can bring themselves up-to-date listening to audio material on their smart phones wherever and whenever they feel so inclined.</p>
        <p align="left">This course consists of 4 groups of educational material -</p> 
        <p align="left">1.	Role play scenarios for your CSA study group</p> 
        <p align="left">2.	Communication skills learning. These are teaching sessions recorded with our communication skills experts to improve your consultations</p> 
        <p align="left">3.	Shared decision options. These are extended option discussions with patients with specific conditions. These recordings are suitable for GPs and patients alike</p> 
        <p align="left">4.	Consultations with patients with problems from all of the GP curriculum areas. This allows you to be comprehensive in your learning. And to tick some boxes in your e-portfolio.</p>
