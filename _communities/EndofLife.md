name: End of Life Care
description: As a community, we are aiming to improve the ways in which people can manage and influence their own care, treatment and support towards the end of their life. We believe that, by developing better tools to share information between health and care professionals, carers and patients,we can help to ensure that the patient feels informed and in control of the care that is given to them.
