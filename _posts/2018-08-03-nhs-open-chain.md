We are delighted to be working with <a href="https://www.openchainproject.org/" target="_blank">The OpenChain Project</a> and support the release of the first case study, a collaboration with NHS England, NHS Digital and AB EHR. This case study offers an insight into how and why the British National Health Service has decided to use the OpenChain Specification as a baseline for effective compliance across its digital projects.

The case study is centered around adoption by the service provider AB EHR for the Code4Health OpenEyes Community.
